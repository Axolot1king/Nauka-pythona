Hi,
There are many tasks ahead of you.
First, take notes from the last lesson.

3 types of functions (without arguments, with and with an argument that is not required [function overloads]) that you know at the moment. In the next classes we will learn more about the possibilities.

Task 1: Divide our created function into 2 and call one function another so that it is executed as many times as the user wants.

Task 2: Create a calculator that will add, subtract, multiply and divide 2 values entered by the user, if he does not provide the second number, the number will be 1.

Task 3: Create a graphic like a piece of paper, in the colors we have chosen.
Additional materials can be found here:

Task 4: Make 10 more typingclub lessons, confirmed with a screenshot and uploaded to the lesson directory.
Good luck
