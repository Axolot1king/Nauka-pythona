Today's task will be simple.

TODO Take notes from the last two lessons
# good notes, but I'm missing something - last loop of lesson 6 (getting the number of characters of a list string)!

TODO Do the typing exercises without looking at the keyboard for task 60 and confirm it with a screenshot.
# Still missing

TODO Display a long sentence in the console by looping and using the list vertically rather than horizontally
#To improve. The program works, but is suboptimal. Apply all the possibilities you have learned.
