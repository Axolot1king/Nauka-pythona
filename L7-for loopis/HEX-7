Today's task will be dengerous.


TODO BOOM!
Create a bomb.
The program is supposed to ask for the code to arm the bomb.
If the four-digit pin is correct, the program starts counting down from 15 to 0.
At the end of the program there will be an announcement about the explosion!
Use a for loop for this.

Needed library and function at the beginning of the code:

# import console cleanup library
from os import system, name

import os
# Console cleaning
os.system('cls')
 
# import time library
from time import sleep
# use pause to wait a second
sleep(1)

*You can use any methods to create a program.

TODO Do the typing exercises without looking at the keyboard for task 70 and confirm it with a screenshot.
